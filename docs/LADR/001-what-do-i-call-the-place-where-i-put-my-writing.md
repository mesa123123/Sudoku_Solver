# What Do I call the place where I put the actual writing of the piece?

Time: 25.12.21 0018

## Context

I'm trying to figure out what I'm going to call the folder I used to call my blog post, I can't go with docs because thats where the meta documentation is going for the project

## Decision

I'm going with write, because its shorter than writing and I don't think is used anywhere else in convention I've seen with project structures I've come across?

## Consequence

* I've made a write directory where I'm putting all the writing I'm doing
* I'll split this directory up further into drafts and completed
