# How Do I Outline Scope Crept Ideas?

Time: 26.12.21 1800

## Context

I'm having more ideas as I go about each project so how do I add these to the roadmap.md file?

## Decision

I'll create another heading under the requirements section that will say "Scope-Creep" to outline they aren't part of the final product and are more about extra credit than anything else

## Consequence

* Roadmap.md will need to be edited to the specification above
