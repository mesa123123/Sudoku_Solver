# How to note down further project ideas

Time: 28.12.21 1301

## Context

I was trying to figure out how to make further writings about technical challenges I overcame/technologies I learned while sorting out articles I'm creating and I want a place to note down where I can put the ideas I have for further articles

## Decision

I'm going to create a "## Further Articles" section in the RoadMap.md to list further ideas

## Consequence

* RoadMap.md will get another section
