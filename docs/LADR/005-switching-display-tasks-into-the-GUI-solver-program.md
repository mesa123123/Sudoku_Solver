# Switching Display GUI tasks into the solver Programme Epic

Time: 19.1.22 0131

## Context

Testing on the grid object had completely worn me out so I decided to look back at the road map in order to get a mental brake and it looked like the GUI display tasks were in the writing.

## Decision

I switched them across to the actual program development

## Consequence

* The RoadMap.md file looks a bit different
