# Part 1: Intro

As I came back to my sleepy home town for the Christmas holidays I discovered that there is something that is shared between both the white collar government workers of windy Wellington and the much more reserved riverside retirees of the Rotorua, when there is nothing to do (and living in an industry like government where getting university educated people to do absolutely [nothing is your stock and trade][FN1]) and the mind tends to gain a sweet tooth for the analytical you tend to reach for the sudoku books.
After the end of year wind down I became very adept at cracking on with the harder of the sudoku puzzles I found online and was more than happy to tackle the puzzles that have so far stumped my parents.
However when your skill set is geared (at least on paper) toward commanding computers to do tedious (read as "boring") things you begin to see that there is a lot of repetition involved in teasing out a solution from your average sudoku puzzle. So naturally after getting the hang of the initial algorithm I thought I'd hand it off to the computer to sort out the tedious bits for me. [Plus I find it much more fun coding the steps to solve every sudoku rather than write it all out by hand][FN2]

[FN1]: "Which is a bloody good thing for people with degrees because after three years at university they are masters of doing very little of anything, so doing nothing at all seems the next logical step in the progression"
[FN2]: "Why spend twenty minutes doing an easy task when you could spend 2 hours (weeks because I decided to write a blog about it) trying to unsuccessfully automate it"
